#  Atlantic Giants

We are a non-profit association, dedicated and committed to future generations.

The association was created in 2019 by Hugo Vau as a way to give back to the Ocean the special moments spent in it exercising his professional activities as a giant wave surfer and fisherman

## Goals

- To train and sensitize society and governmental entities for the recovery and conservation of nature, with main focus on the Oceans, as a fundamental element of Life

- Developing actions, projects and initiatives that support the transition to a society committed to future generations, seeking to explore the various dimensions of sustainability to meet an environmentally responsible, economically viable and socially just society
